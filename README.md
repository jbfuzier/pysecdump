Overview

Just some modification to the original pysecdump to make it work on Win7 (original was not working for me)

Original README :

pysecdump
=========

Python-based tool to dump security information from Windows systems

Overview
========

pysecdump is a python tool to extract various credentials and secrets from
running Windows systems.  It currently extracts:
* LM and NT hashes (SYSKEY protected)
* Cached domain passwords
* LSA secrets
* Secrets from Credential Manager (only some)

pysecdump can also:
* Impersonate other processes - if you want a shell as another user
* Enable currently held windows privileges - see "whoami /priv"

It does exactly the same sort of things already implemented by gsecdump,
Cain & Abel, metasploit and many other tools.

This implementation is in python and that's probably the only notable thing
about this implementation.

If you think python is cool, this project might be of interest.  If you don't,
you should probably stop reading now.

Credits

This is a derivative work of:

creddump - http://code.google.com/p/creddump/

In fact very little of the code is different in pysecdump,
which just pulls data from the registry instead of from on-disk hives

windows-privesc-check - http://code.google.com/p/windows-privesc-check/

This is used mostly for the registry API

I found the metasploit source code very handy for identifying the
appropriate registry keys, so credit to those guys too for a great tool.

Requirements
============

Nothing if you just want to run pysecdump.exe on a windows system.

If you want to modify pysecdump.py then run recreate the .exe you need:

* pywin32 - http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/
* pycrypto - https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/
* pysinatller - http://www.pyinstaller.org/

Usage
=====

Dump cached domain hashes (run as SYSTEM):
<pre>
pysecdump -c
</pre>

Dump LSA secrets (run as SYSTEM):
<pre>
pysecdump -l
</pre>

Dump local password hashes from SAM (run as SYSTEM):
<pre>
pysecdump -s
</pre>

Dump (some secrets) from Credential Manager (run as SYSTEM):
<pre>
pysecdump -C
</pre>

Impersonate process ID 1234:
<pre>
pysecdump -i 1234
whoami /all
</pre>

Enable all currently held windows privileges (can also use with -i):
<pre>
pysecdump -e
whoami /priv
</pre>
  
Converting to .exe
==================
<pre>
cd C:\pyinstaller-2.0
pyinstaller.py -F "c:\somepath\pysecdump.py"
</pre>
  
Features
========

* Is written in python
* Supports XP family and Vista+ registry locations
* Uses impersonation of all available processes when dumping Credential Manager.
